    abstract = "{The problem of estimating the size of a population based on a subset of individuals observed across multiple data sources is often referred to as capture-recapture or multiple-systems estimation. This is fundamentally a missing data problem, where the number of unobserved individuals represents the missing data. As with any missing data problem, multiple-systems estimation requires users to make an untestable identifying assumption in order to estimate the population size from the observed data. If an appropriate identifying assumption cannot be found for a data set, no estimate of the population size should be produced based on that data set, as models with different identifying assumptions can produce arbitrarily different population size estimatesâ€”even with identical observed data fits. Approaches to multiple-systems estimation often do not explicitly specify identifying assumptions. This makes it difficult to decouple the specification of the model for the observed data from the identifying assumption and to provide justification for the identifying assumption. We present a re-framing of the multiple-systems estimation problem that leads to an approach that decouples the specification of the observed-data model from the identifying assumption, and discuss how common models fit into this framing. This approach takes advantage of existing software and facilitates various sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate our approach in a case study estimating the number of civilian casualties in the Kosovo war.}",
