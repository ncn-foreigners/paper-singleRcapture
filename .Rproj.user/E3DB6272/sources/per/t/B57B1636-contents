abstract: >
  Estimating population size is an important issue in official statistics, social sciences and natural sciences. One way to approach  
  this problem is to use capture-recapture methods, which can be classified according to the number of sources used, the main
  distinction being between methods based on one source and those based on two or more sources.
  In this presentation we will introduce the \pkg{singleRcapture} R package for fitting SSCR models. The package implements
  state-of-the-art models as well as some new models proposed by the authors (e.g. extensions of zero-truncated one-inflated and
  one-inflated zero-truncated models). The software is intended for users interested in estimating the size of populations,
  particularly those that are difficult to reach or for which information is available from only one source and dual/multiple system
  estimation cannot be used. 

# In this paper, we focus on the former group, i.e. single-source capture-recapture (SSCR). SSCR models assume that observed counts follow truncated count distributions (e.g. zero-truncated Poisson, one-inflated zero-truncated geometric), and this assumption is used to estimate missing (hidden) zero counts. The literature includes applications of SSCR methods for estimating the number of undocumented migrants, cases of domestic violence or homeless people.

# Introduction

This template demonstrates some of the basic LaTeX that you need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

In general, don't use Markdown, but use the more precise LaTeX commands instead:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}

One exception is inline code, which can be written inside a pair of backticks (i.e., using the Markdown syntax).

If you want to use LaTeX commands in headers, you need to provide a `short-title` attribute. You can also provide a custom identifier if necessary. See the header of Section \ref{r-code} for example.

# \proglang{R} code {short-title="R code" #r-code}

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```

## Features specific to \pkg{rticles} {short-title="Features specific to rticles"}

* Adding short titles to section headers is a feature specific to \pkg{rticles} (implemented via a Pandoc Lua filter). This feature is currently not supported by Pandoc and we will update this template if [it is officially supported in the future](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4409).
* Using the `\AND` syntax in the `author` field to add authors on a new line. This is a specific to the `rticles::jss_article` format.
